the UI seems goos but there are still areas for improvement.

the catalogue could be made better as it seems to be not proper full UI.

the font can be changed and made better.

the buttons can be made Uniform except the delete button.

the show dimension does not move the white circle.

the show optimimezed will work and no where is the indication to click it.

after optmimzation, it needs to prompt to click the button.

after another layout is loaded, there is a bug of the pop up still showing as optimization completed.

showing the layout side by side seems to be enough and there is no need of another extra button to switch views.

the catalogue button is visible after clicking it so it needs to be subtly hidden

adjusting the dimension should be shown in the beginning,

the furniture objects need to have a true to the png bounding box

should add a section beneath the layouts shown as to what were the violations that were fixed later on in the optimimzed layout.
